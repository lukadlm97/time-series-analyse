AR + I + MA
Auto Regression (p) + Integrity(d) + Moving Avarage(q)
Build ARIMA model will give us important factors (p,d,q)
Most important factor is to calcualte this three factors.
p - Parcial coficient factor
d - differencying
q - auto corallation factor
ARIMA is automated machine learning model.

ACF (Auto correlation factor)
	ACF ->1		ACF ->2
100	x1		x1
110	x2		x2
120	x3
130	x4
140	x5
150	x6
.
ACF1 -> [x1=lambda*x2+some residual] - some correlation on next value
ACF2 -> - some correlation on every secound element

- after how many rows this relationshis start to fill?
current observation 
previuse observasion

q - give us idea after hou many rows out relation shis is no more significant (minimize efect of correlations)
q > 0.1 - good correlation (otherwise not good correlation)
