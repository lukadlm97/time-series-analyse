AR + I + MA
Auto Regression (p) + Integrity(d) + Moving Avarage(q)
Build ARIMA model will give us important factors (p,d,q)
Most important factor is to calcualte this three factors.
p - Parcial coficient factor
d - differencying
q - auto corallation factor
ARIMA is automated machine learning model.

ACF (Auto correlation factor)
	ACF ->1		ACF ->2
100	x1		x1
110	x2		x2
120	x3
130	x4
140	x5
150	x6
.
ACF1 -> [x1=lambda*x2+some residual] - some correlation on next value
ACF2 -> - some correlation on every secound element

- after how many rows this relationshis start to fill?
current observation 
previuse observasion

q - give us idea after hou many rows out relation shis is no more significant (minimize efect of correlations)
q > 0.1 - good correlation (otherwise not good correlation)

p - parcial correlation factor
100
110
120
105

direct correlation - values are direcly correlated with each other
what is when 100 is correlated with 110,120,105 -> indirect correlation (partial correlation)
main purpose of parcial correlation is to minimaze correlation in data
on y correlation on x lag/index
p = 2 (last value bigger then boundaries)

i - differencing
y - price x - time strate line -> stationary line
The main goal of differencing in concept in my model assuming you have stationary data.

data is not stationary and the d=1 => xi+shifting(1)
100	110	120	105	109	=>	shifting
	100	110	120	105	109 	=>	first level of substraction
->	10	10	-15	4		=> d=2	=> secound level of differencing (usual it would be last - data will be stationary)
		100	110	120	105
(1.r-4.r)		20	-5	-11	now we have trend
